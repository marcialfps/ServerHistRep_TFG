LanzAR (Lanzarote in Augmented Reality) uses this technology in order to improve the cultural tourism of the island of Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands. Also, it is a social project, where students from art school Pancho Lasso participate in the recording of the historical representations.

LanzAR provides a location-based experience where the user can see historical performances in augmented reality.
